             the colours themselves are meaningless, they were chosen so as to not have
             two similarly coloured countries adjacent to one another. That being said when you click
            on any location on the worldmap it'll update the adjacent barchart to give you
            an indication of some of the basic neccesities available in that country.

            <h2 align="middle"> The Story </h2>
            Across the globe people have varying degrees of access to the basic neccesities to
            live a relatively comfortable life. These are: access to electricity,
            drinkable water and improved sanitation. It is part my belief that the lack of these basic
            neccessities form part of the reason why theres a large influx
            of people coming from areas like sub-Saharan Africa and countries like
            Afghanistan and Pakistan, to the Western World and more specifically Europe.

          <div class="col-sm-12" id="story">
            For instance when one goes to compare Western Europe to rural Africa for example,
            the differences are simply astonishing. The luxaries and neccessities we take for granted
            here in the Europe and most of the globe, are largly absent in rural Africa
            or even urban Africe.

            Compare for instance France to Mali.
            France has a tremendously high GDP compared to Mali, which is its own is already
            quite the economic incentive for people to want to emmigrate from
            Mali to Europe. But more importantly the difference in basic neccesities
            to life a relatively comfortable life is simply astonishing. In France more
            than 95% of the population (urban and rural) has access to electricity, improved sanitation
            and improved water sources.Compare that to Mali where only 77% of the
            population has access to an improved water source
            (64% of the rural population, 97% of the urban population),
            or 27% of the population has access to electricity (51% urban vs 12% rural).

            <h4>This is a story that repeats itself all across Africa and many other parts of the globe.</h4>
            Take war and general instability out of the equation, is it any wonder why so many
            people would want to emigrate to the western world? where the standards of living are higher and
            everyone has access to ample clean, drinkable water, electricty and basic santitation.
