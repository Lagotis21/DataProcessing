                 the colours themselves are meaningless, they were chosen so as to not have

                on any location on the worldmap it'll update the adjacent barchart to give you
                an indication of some of the basic neccesities available in that country.

                Across the globe people have varying degrees of access to the basic neccesities to live a relative comfortable life, electricity,
                drinkable water and improved sanitation. It is my belief that this is one of the major
                inscentives for people to emigrate to the western world from areas like sub-Saharan Africa.

              <div class="col-sm-12" id="story">
                For instance when one compares Western Europe to Eastern Europe there are little
                differences when it comes to access to electricity, water or sanitation.
                But when you compare rural Europe to rural Africa for example the differences are
                astonishing.

                Compare for instance France to Lesotho (situated within the borders of South Africa).
                France has a tremendously high GDP compared to Lesotho, which is quite a the incentive
                for people to want to emmigrate from sub-saharan africa to Europe, but more importantly
                the difference in basic neccesities to life a relatively comfortable life is simply astonishing.
                In France more than 95% of the population has access to electricity, improved sanitation and improved water sources.
                Compare that to Lesotho where only 82% of the population has access to an improved water source,
                or 28% of the population has access to electricity.

                <h3>This is a story that repeats itself all across Africa and many other parts of the globe</h3>
                Take war and general instability out of the equation, is it any wonder why so many
                people would want to emigrate to the western world? where the standards of living are higher and
                everyone has access to ample clean, drinkable water, electricty and basic santitation.
